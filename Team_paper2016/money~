we currently plan that five team members will be travelling to the competition, with total estimated costs £3500 including the robot transfer. 
As we got from the RoCKiN competition 2000€ which is about £1500, we are still paying a half of our badget currently from our pockets. We are trying to find 
sponsornship in the University and companies, however, we haven't yet succeeded. 
The five members is the minimal team to gurantee that we can participate in 3 tasks.
We are asking for additional funding from the following reasons.


First, the funding will be used to support travel for three bachelor students who joined our club in Spring. These students have not yet experiences to be one of the 5 key members, 
but they are really important for continuation of the club. The current members cannot continue for the next year, thus new bachelor students are the future of the club.
As we are the only team who participate in RoCKIn@Home or Robocup@Home from UK, we belive it will be nice to keep as much diversity as possible. 
Additionally, the bachelor students will strongly benefit from attending the competition as important skills as critical thinking, time managment, teamwork are really tested there. 

Second, if more people could travel, we could guarantee that we will be able to participate in more tasks of the competition, including the functional ones. 
We are currently working towards these, but not having the expert on the side might strongly influence our possibility to participate and collect scientific data for benchmarks. 
Moreover, we think that handling all tasks is not possible in five people for high time demand. 

Third, we cooperate also with the team ROSolution from Greece.  Unfortunatelly, the Greece University 
cannot buy a robot nowadays due to Goverment restrictions. Therefore, we are in process of agreement that we will bring a robot for them for the competition. 
However, this increase our demand by £200 for the transfer.
